        <h1>Hiiii Trisha!!</h1>
        <h2> I'm so sorry you didn't get to be asked in person and that experience but I hope this will can come even slightly close to the effort you deserve my love. Trisha, I could say a million things about you because you really are that special, but I'll keep it short. You make life easy, You understand me and so many others, you're so easy to love with your glowing face and glowing eyes (and ur hot body) I can't help but smile when I get that snapchat notification with your name on it, and you make me feel so safe around you even when I'm struggling in life with your undying support and kind words, I know and have seen that you'd never sleep for the rest of your life just for me and thats only the tip of your compassion. I really really really appreciated when you bought me a million things just cause you could, the bracelet is my favourite of them all. Not to mention how talented you are with your nerdy ass getting 90s in the hardest courses known to man, your ability to sing even when you dont ever want to show it to me, and so much more baby. You are so precious to me and in these last couple months I've learned how important you are, so I have just one question to ask...</h2>
